# Quantum-Dice-Game

This a simple quantum dice game created as part of my qiskit learning. It is dice game with dice ranging between zero and seven. Due to the random property of quantum superposition, it is useful for generating random numbers at a time. 
If the prior predicted value has the highest count, the player is declared as winner.
